# Search Algorithms
Search algorithms are methods or procedures used to find a particular item or element within a collection of data. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely applied in various fields. The choice of a search algorithm depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the available resources, and the desired efficiency of the search process.
