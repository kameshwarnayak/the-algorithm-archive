/*
 * Linear Search Algorithm:
 *     Given a list L of n elements with values or records L0 .... Lnâˆ’1, and target value T, the following subroutine uses linear search to find the index of the target T in L.[3]
 *         1. Set i to 0.
 *         2. If Li = T, the search terminates successfully; return i.
 *         3. Increase i by 1.
 *         4. If i < n, go to step 2. Otherwise, the search terminates unsuccessfully.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 *     Worst-case performance:	     O(n)
 *     Best-case performance:	     O(1)
 *     Average performance:          O(n)

  return -1;
};

let arr = [12, 6, 55, 2, 44, 87, 100];

const result = search(arr, target);

result === -1
  ? console.log(`Target ${target} not present in the array`)
  : console.log(`Target ${target} present in position ${result + 1}`);
