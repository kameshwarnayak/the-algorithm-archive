# Linear Search Algorithm: 
#     Given a list L of n elements with values or records L0 .... Lnâˆ’1, and target value T, the following subroutine uses linear search to find the index of the target T in L.[3]
#         1. Set i to 0.
#         2. If Li = T, go to step 4.
#         3. Increase i by 1 and go to step 2.
#         4. If i < n, the search terminates successfully; return i. Else, the search terminates unsuccessfully.
#
# Time Complexity:
#     Worst-case performance:        O(n)
#     Best-case performance:         O(1)
#     Average performance:           O(n)
