# The Algorithm Archive
Explore The Algorithm Archive, a curated collection of optimized algorithm implementations in various languages. From sorting to graph algorithms, each code is well-documented, providing a resource for both learning and efficient integration into your projects. Contribute and elevate the collective understanding of algorithms!

### Commiting Guidelines
- `new<language>`: used when a new algorithm is pushed
- `build`: a commit related to build systems (`npm`, `gulp`, etc.);
- `ci`: a commit which affects the CI/CD tools and/or pipeline;
- `chore`: a commit which affects anything apart from the source code;
- `docs`: a commit affecting the documentation;
- `feat`: a commit which adds a new feature;
- `fix`: a commit which fixes a bug; `message` MUST include the issue number;
- `other`: a global umbrella for _anything_ else;
- `perf`: a commit improving the performance;
- `refactor`: a commit which includes refractoring of the source code; MUST NOT add any features/fixes;
- `revert`: revert to a branch/commit/release/tag;
- `test`: add/amend test cases.
- `git`: a commit that consists of git actions/gitignore edits/instructions for git

The `message` should be a clear, crisp, concise, imperative-tense message giving a bird's eye view of the commit. In case you want to add additional information, you can leave a blank line after the commit and provide whatever detail you need. Soft-break at 100 cols.
